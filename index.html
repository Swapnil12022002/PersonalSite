  But I plan on completing a number of goals this year in order to increase my self believe and bring positivity in my career.<br>Some of them are careeristic while some of them are really about fulfilling the fantsized dreams that I have had since a pretty long time.<br>

   <li><strong>First goal</strong>:<em>To develop and hone my web development skills to the fullest in order to get greater opportunities in the tech world.</em></li>
   <li><strong>Second goal</strong>:<em>To learn android development in the beginner level.</em></li>
   <li><strong>Third goal</strong>:<em>Try to connect with a lot of influencers on linkedin in order to build healthy relations and learn about the way things work in the tech world.</em></li>
   <li><strong>Fourth goal</strong>:<em>Try to master full stack development in three months so that I am capable enough to build a strong freelancing skill.</em></li>
   <li><strong>Fifth goal</strong>:<em>Try to get internship opportunities by participating in hackathons.</em></li>
